 * 
 * (Game: nine heads and tails) Nine coins are placed in a 
 * 3-by-3 matrix with some face up and some face down. You 
 * can represent the state of the coins using a 3-by-3 matrix 
 * with values 0 (heads) and 1 (tails). Here are 
 * some examples:
 *  
 * 0 0 0   1 0 1   1 1 0   1 0 1   1 0 0   
 * 0 1 0   0 0 1   1 0 0   1 1 0   1 1 1 
 * 0 0 0   1 0 0   0 0 1   1 0 0   1 1 0 
 * 
 * Each state can also be represented using a binary number. 
 * For example, the preceding matrices correspond to the 
 * numbers 000010000 101001100 110100001 101110100 100111110 
 * There are a total of 512 possibilities, so you can use 
 * decimal numbers 0, 1, 2, 3, . . . , and 511 to represent 
 * all states of the matrix. Write a program that prompts the 
 * user to enter a number between 0 and 511 and displays the 
 * corresponding matrix with the characters H and T.
